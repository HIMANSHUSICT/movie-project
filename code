Introduction
Overview
To complete my Data Analysis project I am using TMDb movies dataset.

This data set contains information about 10 thousand movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. It consist of 21 columns such as imdb_id, revenue, budget, vote_count etc.

Question that can analyised from this data set
Movies which had most and least profit
Movies with largest and lowest budgets
Movies with most and least earned revenu.
Movies with longest and shortest runtime values
Average runtime of all the movies.
In which year we had most no.of profitable movies.
Successful genres (with respest to the profitable movies).
Most frequent cast (with respest to the profitable movies)
Average budget (with respest to the profitable movies)
Average revenue (with respest to the profitable movies)
Average duration of the movie (with respest to the profitable movies)

Data Wrangling
After observing the dataset and proposed questions for the analysis we will be keeping only relevent data deleting the unsued data so that we can make our calculation easy and understandable. .

General Properties
In [3]:
# Load your data and print out a few lines. Perform operations to inspect data
#   types and look for instances of missing or possibly errant data.

#loading the csv file and storing it in the variable "tmbd_data"
tmdb_data = pd.read_csv('tmdb-movies.csv')

#printing first five rows with defined columns of tmdb-movies database
tmdb_data.head()

5 rows × 21 columns

Obsevations from the data set
1.) No unit of currency is mentioned in the dataset. So for my analysis I will take it as dollar as it is the most used international currency.

2.) vote_count is different for all the movies, so we cannot directly conculed the popularity of the movies based on the average vote count

Data Cleaning (Removing the unused information from the dataset )
Important observation regarding this process

We need to remove unused column such as id, imdb_id, vote_count, production_company, keywords, homepage etc.
Removing the duplicacy in the rows(if any).
Some movies in the database have zero budget or zero revenue, that is there value has not been recorded so we will be discarding such entries
Changing release date column into date format.
Replacing zero with NAN in runtime column.
Changing format of budget and revenue column.
1. Removing Unused columns

Columns that we need to delete are - id, imdb_id, popularity, budget_adj, revenue_adj, homepage, keywords, overview, production_companies, vote_count and vote_average.

In [4]:
#creating a list of columb to be deleted
del_col=[ 'id', 'imdb_id', 'popularity', 'budget_adj', 'revenue_adj', 'homepage', 'keywords', 'overview', 'production_companies', 'vote_count', 'vote_average']

#deleting the columns
tmdb_data= tmdb_data.drop(del_col,1)

#previewing the new dataset

2. Removing the duplicacy in the rows(if any).

Lets see how many entries we have in the database

In [5]:
rows, col = tmdb_data.shape
#We need to reduce the count of row by one as contain header row also.
print('There are {} total entries of movies and {} no.of columns in it.'.format(rows-1, col))
There are 10865 total entries of movies and 10 no.of columns in it.
Now removing the duplicate rows if any!

In [6]:
tmdb_data.drop_duplicates(keep ='first', inplace=True)
rows, col = tmdb_data.shape

print('There are now {} total entries of movies and {} no.of columns in it.'.format(rows-1, col))
There are now 10864 total entries of movies and 10 no.of columns in it.
So there was a duplicate row and it has been removed now.

3. Removing 0's from budget and the revenue columns

In [7]:
# creating a seperate list of revenue and budget column
temp_list=['budget', 'revenue']

#this will replace all the value from '0' to NAN in the list
tmdb_data[temp_list] = tmdb_data[temp_list].replace(0, np.NAN)

#Removing all the row which has NaN value in temp_list 
tmdb_data.dropna(subset = temp_list, inplace = True)

rows, col = tmdb_data.shape
print('So after removing such entries, we now have only {} no.of movies.'.format(rows-1))
So after removing such entries, we now have only 3853 no.of movies.
4. Changing the release date column into standard date format

In [8]:
tmdb_data.release_date = pd.to_datetime(tmdb_data['release_date'])
In [9]:
# printing the changed dataset

Column with id 2107 shows the longest runtime i.e 338 minutes.

Whereas the column with id 5162 shows the shortest runtime i.e 15 minutes

Research Question 5 : Average runtime of the movies
In [18]:
# defining a function to find average of a column
def avg_fun(column):
    return tmdb_data[column].mean()
In [19]:
#calling above function
avg_fun('runtime')
Out[19]:
109.22029060716139
So the average runtime a movie is 109 minutes. Lets analyse it in a visual form i.e. by graphical approach.

In [20]:
#plotting a histogram of runtime of movies

#giving the figure size(width, height)
plt.figure(figsize=(9,5), dpi = 100)

#On x-axis 
plt.xlabel('Runtime of the Movies', fontsize = 15)
#On y-axis 
plt.ylabel('Nos.of Movies in the Dataset', fontsize=15)
#Name of the graph
plt.title('Runtime of all the movies', fontsize=15)

#giving a histogram plot
plt.hist(tmdb_data['runtime'], rwidth = 0.9, bins =35)
#displays the plot
plt.show()

The distribution of the above formed graph is positively skewed or right skewed! Most of the movies are timed between 80 to 115 minutes. Almost 1000 and more no.of movies fall in this criteria.

Lets analyse more about runtime of the movie using different kind of plots i.e Box Plot and Data Point Plot

In [23]:
import seaborn as sns
#The First plot is box plot of the runtime of the movies 
plt.figure(figsize=(9,7), dpi = 105)

#using seaborn to generate the boxplot
sns.boxplot(tmdb_data['runtime'], linewidth = 3)
#diplaying the plot
plt.show()
C:\Users\antra\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\seaborn\categorical.py:462: FutureWarning: remove_na is deprecated and is a private function. Do not use.
  box_data = remove_na(group_data)

In [24]:
#The Second plots is the data points plot of runtime of movies

plt.figure(figsize=(10,5), dpi = 105)
#using seaborn to generate the plot
sns.swarmplot(tmdb_data['runtime'], color = 'green')
#displaying the plot
plt.show()

In [25]:
#getting specific runtime 
tmdb_data['runtime'].describe()
Out[25]:
count    3854.000000
mean      109.220291
std        19.922820
min        15.000000
25%        95.000000

75%       119.000000
max       338.000000
Name: runtime, dtype: float64
Thats amazing!! The plot generated above give a visual of complete distribution of runtime of movies by plotting the points againts their respective position in the ditribution

Coming to our first plot i.e. box-plot, It gives us an overall idea of how spreaded the ditribution is in case of runtime of the movies. we also get the outliners her if you carefully observe the plot.

By looking at both the plot and calculations, we can conclude that..

25% of movies have a runtime of less than 95 minutes
50% of movies have a runtime of less than 109 minutes. (median)
75% of movies have a runtime of less than 119 minutes
Research Question 6 : Year of release vs Profitability
In [26]:
#We will be using Line plot for this analysis
#Since we want to know the profits of movies for every year therefore we have to sum up all the movies of a particular year

profits_year = tmdb_data.groupby('release_year')['profit_earned'].sum()

#figure size(width, height)
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6), dpi = 130)

#on x-axis
plt.xlabel('Release Year of Movies in the data set', fontsize = 12)
#on y-axis
plt.ylabel('Profits earned by Movies', fontsize = 12)
#title of the line plot
plt.title('Representing Total Profits earned by all movies Vs Year of their release.')

#plotting the graph
plt.plot(profits_year)

#displaying the line plot
plt.show()

In [27]:
#To find that which year made the highest profit?
profits_year.idxmax()
Out[27]:
2015
So we can conclude both graphically as well as by calculations that year 2015 was the year where movies made the highest profit.

We are now done with analysing the given dataset.We will now find characteristics of profitable movies.

With respect to the profitable movies
Before moving further we need to clean our data again. We will be considering only those movies who have earned a significant amount of profit.

So lets fix this amount to 50 million dollar.

In [54]:
#selecting the movies having profit $50M or more
profit_data = tmdb_data[tmdb_data['profit_earned'] >= 50000000]

#reindexing new data
profit_data.index = range(len(profit_data))

#we will start from 1 instead of 0
profit_data.index = profit_data.index + 1

#printing the changed dataset
profit_data.head(3)

Conclusions
This was a very interesting data analysis. We came out with some very interesting facts about movies. After this analysis we can conclude following:

For a Movie to be in successful criteria

Average Budget must be around 60 millon dollar
Average duration of the movie must be 113 minutes
Any one of these should be in the cast :Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks, Sylvester Stallone,Cameron Diaz
Genre must be : Action, Adventure, Thriller, Comedy, Drama.
By doing all this the movie might be one of the hits and hence can earn an average revenue of around 255 million dollar.

Limitations: This analysis was done considering the movies which had a significant amount of profit of around 50 million dollar. This might not be completely error free but by following these suggestion one can increase the probability of a movie to become a hit. Moreover we are not sure if the data provided to us is completel corect and up-to-date. As mentioned before the budget and revenue column do not have currency unit, it might be possible different movies have budget in different currency according to the country they are produce in. So a disparity arises here which can state the complete analysis wrong. Dropping the rows with missing values also affected the overall analysis.
